🎓 University Landing Pages with Lead Capture & APIs

This project delivers a fully responsive frontend system featuring two single-page landing pages for private universities, a lead-generation workflow integrated with Pipedream, and a set of basic APIs returning simple and nested JSON responses. It is designed to showcase practical skills in building real-world landing pages, handling form submissions, and deploying production-ready web applications.

🔹 Landing Pages (LP-1 & LP-2)

Each landing page highlights essential university information, including an overview, available courses, fee details, placement insights, and campus facilities. The UI focuses on clarity, engagement, and easy navigation, supported by strong CTAs like Check Course-wise Fees, Download Brochure, and Apply Now. Both pages are built with mobile-first responsiveness to ensure smooth performance across devices.

🔹 Lead Form Integration

A dynamic lead form collects user inputs: Full Name, Email, Phone Number (10-digit India), State, Course Interested, Intake Year, and a mandatory consent checkbox. On submission, the form sends data to a connected Pipedream workflow endpoint using a fetch-based POST request. A success or error message is displayed instantly without page reload, enhancing the user experience.

🔹 APIs

The project includes lightweight APIs that return structured JSON data for university details, course lists, and fee breakdowns. These endpoints demonstrate backend understanding and can be consumed by any frontend.

🔹 Deployment

Both landing pages are deployed on a free hosting service with SSL enabled, ensuring secure access and production-ready behavior.
